# lightship
A game about an old spaceship exploring a planet, with falling sand! Enjoy destruction in a destructible environment, where everything is simulated.

Currently a work in progress.

For the time being, source code won't be public. But whenever I feel it, builds are made in releases: https://github.com/Voxelstice/lightship/releases
